          <h3>Interbank Call Money Lent (FFS)</h3>
          <p>Banks with excess reserve balances can lend to other banks.
            When Call Money is "Lent" the selling bank has an asset and the "Borrowing" bank has a liability.
            Most call money loans in the real world have a one-day maturity, so you should think of ProBanker as asking
            you to select an average balance of FFS for your bank to hold over the coming quarter.
            FFS earn an expected return equal to the riskless 90-day CD rate, which is known for certain when Bank
            decisions are made. However, the actual FFS rate will differ from the 90-day CD rate by a random factor that reflects
            unanticipated money market developments during the quarter. (Because most FFS lending has a very short
            maturity
            the average Fed Funds rate over the coming quarter cannot be known when you are making your decisions.)
            Your bank's ultimate FFS position also may differ from what you entered, because FFS balances plays a part
            in balancing
            the balance sheet.</p>
          <h3>Interbank Call Money Borrowed (FFP)</h3>
          <p>
            The CEO can borrow from other banks and financial institutions through the overnight Call Money market. If
            some purchased funds turn out to be un-needed, the bank pays a transaction cost to borrow them initially
            and to re-lend them in the market as FFS.
            A sound bank will pay a rate on FFP that is equal to that earned on FFS. However, as a bank's leverage
            increases above some threshold value, its interest rate paid on FFP may include a default risk premium.
            Market investors will also stop lending to a bank that appears too risky.
            If your bank becomes too highly levered, uninsured lenders (FFP, Negotiable CDs) demand a higher interest
            rate to cover perceived default risk. Very highly levered banks will be unable to obtain all the funds they
            request in these markets.
            Unless your bank is very highly levered, you will successfully issue all the perfect market liabilities
            (FFP and Negotiable CDs) you specify. As your leverage increases beyond some critical value, however, you
            will be required to pay a default risk premium on these liabilities.
            Once the required default risk premium gets to a second critical value, investors will refuse to purchase
            all of the FFP or Negotiable CDs liabilities you would like to sell. At a very high leverage ratio, you
            will be able to sell no new uninsured claims.
          </p>
          <h3>Wholesale Deposits</h3>
          <p>
            Your bank may issue large certificate of deposit (CD) obligations to obtain loanable funds. Usually, you
            may issue whatever volume of new CDs you wish, in each of three maturity categories: one, two, or four
            quarters. The cost of CD funds depends on your firm's leverage: banks with relatively
            low leverage can issue CDs at the (riskless) treasury rate for bonds with the same maturity. As your bank's
            leverage increases beyond some threshold level, however, your required CD rate also rises.
            The market may ration your CD issues if you have very high leverage.
            Riskless CD rates for the coming quarter equal the same-maturity government bond's yield, as reported in
            ProBanker's end-of-quarter Bond Reports. However, a highly levered bank's actual cost of CD funds may
            incorporate a default premium above the riskless rate. The market also refuses to purchase CDs at any price
            once the bank's leverage has become sufficiently high.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tab2" class="tabcontent decisiontab animated fadeInLeft">
          <h3>New 8-quarter Government Bonds to Purchase</h3>
          <p>
            These are fixed-coupon government bonds. New bonds are purchased at par, but subsequent market rate changes
            affect bond market values.
            (A bond's current market value is obtained by discounting its remaining cash flows at the riskless interest
            rate for the corresponding time to maturity.
            You may purchase only bonds with an initial maturity of 8 quarters which is the longest maturity in
            ProBanker's horizon. </p>


          <h3>Government Bonds to Sell</h3>
          <p>
            You select which bonds to sell by specifying their maturity date and book value.
            The Economic Environment Report specifies the corporate tax rate on capital gains (losses) when bonds are
            sold before maturity.
            Having purchased some government bonds in an earlier time period, you may now wish to sell them, in order
            to make additional loans,
            to reduce your bank's leverage, or to realize accrued capital gains. . Government bonds may not be sold
            short.</p>


          <h3>Provision for loan loss</h3>
          <p>
            Actual losses on maturing loans are charged to the Loan Loss Allowance (LLA) contra-asset account when they
            occur, on the first day of each simulation period.
            LLA changes through time in the following:
            <br><br>
            LLAt = LLAt-1 + PLLt - (Actual Losses)t
            <br><br>
            PLL is the "Provision for Loan Losses." As realized loan losses deplete the LLA, bank managers charge an
            expense item (PLL) each quarter to restore the allowance
            account. Your regulator requires that you maintain a LLA equal to a fixed proportion of your current
            nonperforming loans. Initially, this proportion is 100%,
            but your Administrator can change this requirement. The applicable proportion is reported near the bottom
            of the Economic Environment Report.
            The Provision for Loan Losses cannot be a negative number. Therefore, if you make an excessively large
            Provision one quarter,
            you cannot quickly reverse it the following quarter.
          </p>


          <h3>Target Reserve for Deposits</h3>
          <p>
            By regulation, each bank must hold cash or central bank deposits equal to a proportion of its deposit
            account balances.
            In ProBanker, reserve balances must be at least 10% of all demand deposits outstanding.
            At the end of each quarter, your bank will show two types of reserves: Required Reserves(link) and Excess
            Reserves(link).
            ProBanker asks you to estimate how much required reserves you will have for the coming quarter. This is
            your "Target Reserves for Deposits."
            If your allocation turns out to be insufficient, ProBanker will transfer resources from other asset
            categories.
            If your allocation turns out to be too large, the extra reserve balances may be used to finance
            investments, or they may show up as
            "Excess Reserve Balances (at other commercial banks)."

            costs to collect from customers in the form of fees charged.<p>
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <p>Given that,<br />Annual retail DD operating costs = 3% of balances </p>
              <p>And you set <br />
                Fees = 66% (entered as "0.66") </p>
              <p>Your net cost of maintaining retail demand balances would be:<br />
                Net cost (per year) = 3%*(1-0.66) = 1%</p>
              <p>If you charged fees of "160", you would more than recover your cost of providing DD services.
                With this fee, you would be making a <b>profit of 1.8% per year</b> on your DD balances.</p>
              <p><b>So, why not just set high fees?</b></p>
              <p>Because high fees are equivalent to <b>"paying negative interest"</b>,
                which <b>reduces the attractiveness</b> of your deposit accounts.</p>
              <h3>Deposits</h3>
              <p>Each quarter, you choose a separate interest rate and advertising budget for each
                of these accounts. New balances earn this new rate, while the rates paid in past
                periods continue to apply to older deposits.<p>

                    account at your bank.</p>
                  <p><b>Stronger customer relationships make account balances less sensitive to
                      short-run changes</b> in account pricing, and therefore correspond to lower adjustment speeds.
                    Generally, smaller accounts and those with shorter maturities are less price-sensitive.
                    For example, customer relationship effects are more important for savings accounts than
                    for fixed deposits or corporate loans.</p>
                  <h3>Savings Account Deposits</h3>
                  <p>No explicit maturity</p>
                  <h3>Fixed deposits</h3>
                  <p>8-period maturity</p>
                  <p>Implicit interest and reputation effects are moderate</p>
                  <h3>Certificate of deposits (CD)</h3>
                  <p>Your bank may issue large CD obligations to obtain loanable funds.
                    Usually, you may issue whatever volume of new CDs you wish,
                    in each of three maturity categories: one, two, or four quarters. <p>
                      <p>The cost of CD funds depends on your firm's leverage: banks with
                        relatively low leverage can issue CDs at the (riskless)
                        treasury rate for bonds with the same maturity. As your bank's leverage increases beyond
                        some threshold level, however, your required CD rate also rises.</p>
                      <p>The market may ration your CD issues if you have very high leverage.</p>

              them. These free services frequently relate to check clearing, and hence lower the cost of servicing your
              demand deposit customers. ER balances earn implicit interest at a rate equal to about 90% (more
              precisely, 1.0 minus the DDC reserve requirement) of the period's average risk-free federal funds rate.
              (This rate of implicit compensation for interbank demand balances assumes perfect competition for such
              balances.) If implicit interest earned exceeds noninterest DD operating costs, the excess is lost to the

              The default setting does not allow banks to pay explicit interest on any type of demand deposit account.
              However, ProBanker permits your Administrator to set positive interest rate ceilings on either type of
              demand deposit--so check your Regulatory Environment Report to see what regulations apply to your
              simulations.
              In addition to the possibility of explicit interest payments, ProBanker banks compete for demand deposit
              by
              paying implicit interest in two forms. First, you can direct advertising expenditures to either type of
              DD
              account. Second, you can vary the level of your checking-related fees to make your DD accounts more
              or less attractive. Lower fees elicit greater DD account balances, but your noninterest revenue will also
              be lower. Setting the fee rate above 100% makes DD services a profitable activity, but it reduces your
              available "interest free" DD balances.
              Both types of DD balances are positively related to the effective rate paid on them, negatively related
              to the
              level of market interest rates, and positively related to the level of GDP. DDC are more interest-elastic
              than
              DDR. Demand deposit accounts have substantial customer relationship effects, especially among retail
              customers. DDC balances differ from DDR in two additional ways:
               DDC balances increase with the volume of corporate loans outstanding, reflecting the
              compensating balance arrangements that often accompany FR and FL.
               DDC balances fall when the bank's leverage increases beyond some critical level, as
              customers fear that they will lose their uninsured funds if the bank fails.

              may incorporate a default premium above the riskless rate. The market also refuses to purchase CDs at any
              price once the bank's leverage has become sufficiently high.

              <p>Don't try to flip back and forth between Autosim and Competitive Games,
                hoping to learn what will happen in the Competitive environment from an Autosim
                simulation because your "real" competitors are unlikely to behave the same way as
                Autosim's pre-programmed competitors do. Use Autosim to learn about ProBanker, then
                switch over to the Competitive environment permanently.</p>

              <h2>ProBanker's Tax System</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>ProBanker’s tax system is simpler than the current U.S. tax code. Specifically,
                ProBanker has no provision for tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks. This means that if
                your bank runs a loss, the income statement will show the associated taxes, but that entry
                does not influence your Net Income.</p>

              <h2>Caution</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>
              <p>If your bank becomes too highly levered, uninsured lenders (FFP, Negotiable CDs) demand a
                higher interest rate to cover perceived default risk. Very highly levered banks will be unable to
                obtain all the funds they request in these markets. </p>

          </li>

              <h2>Quantity-Set Items</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>Perfect-market security is when individual buyers and sellers can trade large quantities without having a noticeable effect on the security's price. Perfect- market securities must
                be available in large supply, and have very low default risk -- or at least have default probabilities
                that are widely understood. A financial institution will buy and sell perfect market securities to fill
                gaps in its balance sheet, or as a means of speculating on interest rate changes. ProBanker's
                Quantity-Set assets and liabilities trade in perfect markets.</p>

              <h2>Federal Funds</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>Fed funds are short-term (usually overnight), unsecured loans between banks.</p>
              <p><u>Sellers (lenders)</u> use Fed funds as a marginal interest-earning investment.
                A lender of Federal Funds carries an asset item called Federal Funds Sold.</p>
              <p><u>Fed fund purchasers (borrowers)</u> use this source of funds to finance their asset portfolios.
                The borrower shows a liability item, Federal Funds Purchased.</p>

              <h2>Advertising</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>In ProBanker, there are two reasons to advertise:</p>
              <p><b>1.</b> Banks were historically limited in their ability to pay market rates on some types
                of deposits. In place of explicit interest, they competed by offering convenient offices and
                long banking hours, free gifts, etc.</p>
              <p><b>2.</b> Banks advertise because some implicit compensation may be more valuable to customers
                 than the same expenditure on explicit interest. In ProBanker, customers always respond to higher
                 advertising expenditures, although at a diminishing rate. For some types of accounts and over
                 a limited range, advertising may be more highly valued than explicit interest (which is taxable
                 to the recipient).</p>
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>
              <h2>Competition from Primary Market</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>Each bank's most direct competition comes from other banks in the same competitive Region.
                However, customers living in the Region are not required to bank with a local bank. If Regional
                banks offered a good deal, they'd bank locally. But if all Regional loan rates were high or
                deposit rates were low, some potential customers would seek loans or shop for better rates from
                distant banks or their suppliers. </p>
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>
              <h2>Effective Rate of Interest</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>Customers compute an effective interest rate by combining the explicit interest rate, implicit
                benefits from advertising expenditures and fees charged. Customers then compare effective rates
                across Regional competitors (and against open market alternatives) in order to pick the best
                deal.</p>

              <h2>Deposit Rate Ceilings</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>Your Game Administrator can impose a rate ceiling on one or more of the following five deposit
                products (retail CDs, passbook, LTRDs, and retail and corporate demand deposits). Information about
                prevailing rate ceilings is provided in the Economic Environment Report. ProBanker will inform you if
                your chosen deposit rate violates an operative regulatory ceiling.</p>

              <h2>Marginal Cost of Deposits</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>The marginal cost of deposits is your cost of raising an additional dollar of deposit balances. The
                marginal cost has two components:</p>
                <p><b>1.</b> It includes the rate that you pay to the "marginal" depositor.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b> Since all depositors are paid the same rate, you must also account for the additional
                  interest paid to your "infra-marginal" depositors. </p>
                <p><i>The marginal cost of deposits is <u>always at least as great</u> as the deposit rate being paid.</i></p>
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>
              <h2>Marginal Revenue</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>The marginal revenue from a particular type of loan is the total interest revenue gained by making an additional, one-dollar loan.
                The marginal revenue has two components:</p>
                <p><b>1.</b> It includes the interest you receive from the "marginal" borrower.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b> Since all borrowers are charged the same loan rate, you must also take into account the lower
                  interest payments that you will receive from your "infra-marginal" borrowers.</p>
                <p><i>The marginal revenue on loans can <u>never be greater than</u> the loan rate being charged.</i></p>

              <h2>Loanable Funds</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>Loanable funds are the dollars you can lend when you issue more of some liability.
                They are the dollars a bank can use to purchase productive assets, after setting
                aside its required cash reserves.</p>

              <p>-	Average DD balances tend to move inversely with market interest rates.</p>
              <p>-	When market rates rise, the bank loses some DD balances.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Effective Maturity of DD:</b></p>
              <p>-	Depends upon how much and how quickly depositors adjust their average account
                balances in response to market interest rate changes.</p>
              <p>-	If account balance is the same regardless of interest rate levels, DD would

              <p>The first set of capital standards was completed. It involved only the bank’s credit
                (default) risk exposures.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>End of 1992</b></p>
              <p>U.S. regulators fully implemented risk-based standards - Banks had to set aside 8% of
                risk adjusted assets of which 4% has to be in Tier I capital consisting mainly of
                equity instruments.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>August 1995</b></p>
              <p>The banking agencies have incorporated "market risk" into their formal risk-based
                capital standards, but only for very large institutions.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>January 1998</b></p>
              <p>Any bank or banking holding company whose trading activities exceed the smaller of
                $1 billion or 10% of the institution's total assets, had to hold capital to protect against
                losses in their foreign exchange, equity, interest-rate, or commodity trading books.
                The amount of this capital can be specified by each bank’s own internal model of the largest
                loss it expects to incur (at the 99% confidence level). This capital will be added to the
                capital required to cover the institution's credit risk on traditional activities.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>2006</b></p>
              <p>Basel II was adopted which added a more comprehensive approach requiring banks to satisfy three pillars:</p>
              <p>- Pillar 1 mandated minimum capital for credit, market and operation risk using standardized or
                Internal Ratings-Based approach.</p>
              <p>-	Pillar II focused on supervision and internal processes to complement the adequacy of
                capital.</p>
              <p>-	Pillar III focused on disclosure and the importance of providing transparent information
                to the public.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>2008</b></p>
              <p>The financial crisis highlighted major inadequacies in the minimum capital assessments and
                Basel III was proposed and adopted for implementation by 2019.</p>
              <p>Although it maintained the 8% overall capital, it increased the core Tier I ratios
                to 6% and added on two more requirements; </p>
              <p><b>1.</b>	A capital conservation buffer of 2.5%</p>
              <p><b>2.</b>	A potential countercyclical capital buffer that could add another 2.5%.</p>
